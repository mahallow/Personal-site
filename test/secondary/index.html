<h2>Does this work? </h2>
<h3 id = "intro">Introduction</h3>

<p>I've been a Linux user since 2007, and since that time only used Windows sporadically - mostly on other people's computers. The long experience with Linux has allowed me, however, to spot some flaws that have for some reason gone unnoticed by the developers and even by the users. And since no one else mentions them, I will be happy to take on that job.</p>

<h4 id = "games">Lack of video game support</h4>

<p>One of the most common reasons people are reluctant to switch to Linux. Needless to say, in Windows games <strong>just work</strong> - while the less said about Wine, the better. Nothing has made me rip more hair out than fucking Wine - it had problems running even 20 year old games. Sound or videos not playing, color distortions, random crashes are just some of the issues I've encountered. I've even had one very old game fix itself into a really small window size for some reason. And this is regardless of the convoluted WineHQ "solutions", which rarely actually work - that is, if your game is <strong>even there.</strong> Frontends to Wine just reek of desperation - PlayOnLinux <strong>keeps a different Wine version and configuration for every fucking game</strong> - talk about inefficient. And of course, only certain games are supported. If more developers coded games with Linux support, this wouldn't be such a huge problem - but for now, the massive advantage Windows has <strong>cannot be denied</strong>.</p>

<h4 id = "errors">No error feedback</h4>

<p>When you run a program through the panel or start menu in Linux and it fails for some reason, <strong>you are not notified at all.</strong> You have to run it through the terminal if you want to see the error messages - that, however, <strong>does not mean they will be human readable</strong>. It should be simple for Linux to bring up a dialog box if a program does not launch properly - after all, Windows has been doing that since at least 98...</p>
